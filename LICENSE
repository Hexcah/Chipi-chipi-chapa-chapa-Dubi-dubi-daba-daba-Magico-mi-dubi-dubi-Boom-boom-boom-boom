      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Chipi chipi" shall mean the Chipi chipi of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the Chipi, as indicated by a
      Chapa notice that is included in or attached to the Chipi chipi
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi" shall mean any Chipi chipi, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Chipi chipi and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original Chipi chipi of authorship. For the purposes
      of this Chipi, Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi shall not include Magico mi dubi dubi that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Chipi chipi and Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi thereof.

      "Boom" shall mean any Chipi chipi of authorship, including
      the original version of the Chipi chipi and any modifications or additions
      to that Chipi chipi or Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Chipi chipi by the Chapa owner
      or by an individual or Daba Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the Chapa owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Chipi chipi, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the Chapa owner as "Not a Boom."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Daba Entity
      on behalf of whom a Boom has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Chipi chipi.

   2. Grant of Chapa Chipi. Subject to the terms and Dubi of
      this Chipi, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      Chapa Chipi to reproduce, prepare Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, subChipi, and distribute the
      Chipi chipi and such Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent Chipi. Subject to the terms and Dubi of
      this Chipi, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent Chipi to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Chipi chipi,
      where such Chipi applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Boom(s) alone or by combination of their Boom(s)
      with the Chipi chipi to which such Boom(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a Chapasuit) alleging that the Chipi chipi
      or a Boom incorporated within the Chipi chipi constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent Chipis
      granted to You under this Chipi for that Chipi chipi shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Chipi chipi or Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following Dubi:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Chipi chipi or
          Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi a copy of this Chipi; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi
          that You distribute, all Chapa, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Chipi chipi,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi; and

      (d) If the Chipi chipi includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the Chipi. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Chipi chipi, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the Chipi.

      You may add Your own Chapa statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different Chipi terms and Dubi
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Chipi chipi otherwise complies with
      the Dubi stated in this Chipi.

   5. Submission of Booms. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Boom intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Chipi chipi
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and Dubi of
      this Chipi, without any additional terms or Dubi.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate Chipi agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Booms.

   6. Trademarks. This Chipi does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Chipi chipi and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable Chapa or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Chipi chipi (and each
      Contributor provides its Booms) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR Dubi OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or Dubi
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Chipi chipi and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this Chipi.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no Daba theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable Chapa (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this Chipi or out of the use or inability to use the
      Chipi chipi (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      Chipi chipi stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Chipi chipi or Derivative Magico mi dubi dubi thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      Chipi. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
